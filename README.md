Mind Palace
===========

After creating a PAO (person,action,object) mind palace, I needed to train
converting back and forth between numbers and mind images as well is between
playing cards and mind images.

This tiny php/javascript website selects a random number (or 3 depending on
training mode) from 0 to 99 (or a subgroup of these numbers) and then shows
the number/card or the mind image (depending on training mode). You can then
do the needed mind association. After any click the full mind association
is revealed, so I can check if I was correct.

I hope to add timing and time limits as will, to force speed improvements.
